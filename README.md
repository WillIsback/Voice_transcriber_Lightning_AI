# Voice Transcriber with Lightning.AI

Welcome to my project! I am leveraging the power of Lightning.AI, a state-of-the-art cloud computing and IDE solution, to develop a voice transcriber model. Our model takes French speech as input and generates text files as output.

## Our Journey

Our journey begins with an educational exploration of the Lightning PyTorch library. We'll dive deep into its functionalities and capabilities to understand how we can best utilize it for our project.

Next, we'll decide on a model architecture that is compatible with our requirements. We're looking for a model that not only transcribes speech to text but does so in real-time, handling the speed and flow of natural conversation.

Finally, we'll choose a pre-trained model that's suitable for our task. The goal is to leverage existing knowledge and avoid reinventing the wheel, speeding up our development process and improving the accuracy of our transcriptions.

## Multi-Speaker Differentiation

A unique feature of our model is its ability to differentiate between multiple speakers. This is a complex task, but we're up for the challenge. We'll be using the open-source library PyAnote to assist us in this endeavor.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress in our exciting journey!
